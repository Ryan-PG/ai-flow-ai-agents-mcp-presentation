# 🎥 AI Flows, AI Agents, and MCP - Presentation at Keyhan Qom

Welcome to the official repository for my presentation titled **"AI Flows, MCP, and AI Agents"**, held at **Keyhan Qom**. This talk explores the practical architecture of modern AI systems, the concept of **Memory-Context-Prediction (MCP)**, and how these ideas come together to power **autonomous AI agents**.
